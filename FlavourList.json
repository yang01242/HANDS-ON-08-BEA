Then, smooth, pureed cashews are stirred in, adding a creamy, velvety texture that balances the rich chocolate base. The result is an irresistible, silky-smooth hot chocolate with a subtle nutty sweetness and an unexpected, but oh-so-delicious, depth of flavour.\n\nOn the side, enjoy the smoky sweetness of butternut squash, slow-smoked to perfection and pureed into a silky smooth blend that’s both earthy and subtly caramelized. This velvety squash puree is then swirled into a rich, traditional vanilla custard, creating a harmonious balance of flavours that’s both comforting and surprising. The mixture is lovingly spooned into a flaky, buttery croissant cup, offering a delicious contrast of textures with every bite. The result? A dessert that's warm, decadent, and deeply satisfying—a perfect blend of sweet, savoury, and smoky in every spoonful.\n\nDine-in only, contains nuts.",
